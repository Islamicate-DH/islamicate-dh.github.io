# Addenda

## Conceptual Summary of Jockers’ Chapter II

- reading files into R variables
- removing what is not the actual text (splitting, using tagging/metadata, or some other markers)
- normalizing text (`lowercasing`, removing non-letter characters, normalizing spelling variations, removing noise-characters, like short vowels in Arabic)
- collecting first simple descriptive statistics (unique words, word frequencies, etc.)

### Challenges for Arabic Corpus

- What is the most difficult text in terms of the richness of its vocabulary?
- What is the easiest text—in the same terms?
- What are caveats in evaluating the richness of vocabulary?
