title: The Islamicate World 2.0 Course
subtitle: Studying Islamic Cultures through Computational Textual Analysis
---

_The Islamicate World 2.0: Studying Islamic Cultures through Computational Textual Analysis_ is a [Global Classrooms course](https://globalmaryland.umd.edu/content/global-classrooms) that will be offered for the first time in the fall of 2016 by the University of Maryland (College Park) and Universität Leipzig. In this exciting, new project-based course, students from both institutions will come together to learn the basics of computational textual analysis while participating as student researchers in the nascent project of exploring the vast and largely unexplored tomes of textual data about the Islamicate world. It will also introduce students to theoretical and methodological debates in the field of global digital humanities. Like the digital humanities field that inspires its approach, it will be a highly interdisciplinary course that studies texts from multiple genres (lyric poetry to historical chronicles, legal treatises to the Quran) and languages (Arabic, Persian) with the aid of computational textual analysis tools. There are no language prerequisites, but it is preferable if students at least have elementary knowledge of either Arabic, Persian, Turkish, or Urdu.

## Course Description
In this Global Classrooms course, University of Maryland and Universität Leipzig students will come together to learn the basics of computational textual analysis while participating as student researchers in the nascent project of exploring the vast and largely unexplored tomes of textual data about the Islamicate world. It will also introduce students to theoretical and methodological debates in the field of global digital humanities. Like the digital humanities field that inspires its approach, it will be a highly interdisciplinary course that studies texts from multiple genres (lyric poetry to historical chronicles, legal treatises to the Quran) and languages (Arabic, Persian) with the aid of computational textual analysis tools. There are no language prerequisites, but it is preferable if students at least have elementary knowledge of either Arabic, Persian, Turkish, or Urdu.

**NB:** Keep in mind that semesters start and end at different periods at UMD and UL. For this reason, the course at UMD starts on August 30th, 2016 (room ...); while at UL—on October 4th, 2016; the course will meet until December 12th, 2016; after that UL group will continue working on their projects until the end of the semester at UL (Room at UL: P402 @ Neu Paulinum). [More information on the UL specifics...](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J2c7VkYeEpf8YogXGWJnrzzVUIgnGoDA6KOLS1A6Tc0/edit?usp=sharing).

**_NB: These books are available through UMD libraries and in e-book format._**

Download R and R Studio (R is the actual programming language, while RStudio is a convenient interface for interacting with R; you need to download and install both — first R, then RStudio):  
[https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)   
[https://www.rstudio.com/](https://cran.r-project.org/) 

**_NB: Students must have or be able to borrow a laptop for classwork. This course requires extensive use of a computer._**

## Course Goals 
By the end of this course students will have:  
(1) become acquainted with the major debates and tools in computational textual studies;  
(2) developed intermediate-level skills in the R programming language;  
(3) gained extensive experience working in international teams (termed “collaboratories” here) to solve complex problems;  
(4) produced a mini-research publication that will be published on the course site (with the student’s permission).

## Expectations and Grading Procedures
The grade breakdown for this class is as follows (and see more details on each element in subsections below):   
30% Class Participation (including, co-discussion leading)  
20% Class Assignments  
40% Final (Group) Project  
10% Class (Group) Presentation

_See undergraduate catalogue for description of grades—e.g., A+, A, A-, etc.— [here](http://www.umd.edu/catalog/index.cfm/show/content.section/c/27/ss/1584/s/1534).  

#### Class Participation (30%)     
We cannot stress enough how important your regular attendance and active participation in class discussion is for your grade (for attendance policy, see #1 in the “Course Procedures and Policies” section below). Regardless of whether we are discussing readings or engaging in collaborative in-class work, this class will primarily be student-driven and so it is imperative that you come to class having prepared the requisite materials and assignments well.  
Additionally, you will be asked to serve as co-discussion leaders (alongside the instructors) on a rotating basis for the sessions in which we have specific assigned readings. You will be responsible for introducing and contextualizing the readings for the class and formulating class discussion questions based on the readings.     

#### Class Assignments (20%)
Beginning in the fifth week of the semester, you will be assigned specific assignments to complete in R. Sometimes these will be the exercises in the Arnold/Tilton and Jockers introductions to R, other times they will be supplemental R practice exercises from other R tutorials, such as {Swirl} (see: http://swirlstats.com/). These assignments will be posted in ELMS and they must be turned in before class time in order to receive credit.

#### Final (Group) Project (40%) (and the Research Collaboratories)
This course is a project-based learning course. The final project, therefore, will occupy a substantial amount of our class time throughout the semester and will be a major component of your final grade. But, fear not! The instructors will work closely with each of you and your groups to construct a collaborative research project. You will spend much of the second half of the course working on this project during class time with your fellow group members in the “research collaboratory” groups that we will form in week 11. At the conclusion of each research collaboratory session, tasks will be assigned to each group member which must be completed before the next class period. They will also be reported to the instructors after class so they can keep track of each individual’s contributions to the project. These tasks will vary greatly on the basis of each group’s project: some students may be working on cleaning and/or reformatting texts, others on developing a R script, and still others may be tasked with doing traditional humanities research in order to properly contextualize the results of the group’s new computational textual analysis.
We do not expect that you will have all of the answers when you begin work on your final project. You will need to play and experiment with the texts and different modes of textual analysis and visualization available to you in R, and you certainly will hit dead ends and completely fail (productively) at times too. In this process, however, you will learn a great deal, as the research on experiential and problem/project-based learning has shown. We will guide you throughout your work on the final project, making sure that it eventually comes together to form a micro-publication by the end of the course. 
You will present on and submit your final projects on the assigned exam day for this course, Monday, December 19, 1:30-3:30.

#### Class presentation (10%)
Your class presentation is an opportunity for you to present your group’s final project to the class. It should be between 20-30 minutes in length. You should provide an overview of your initial hypothesis, methods of analysis, problems you encountered in your research, and your research findings (including, how they corroborate or problematize the existing scholarly narratives). You will be graded on the quality of both your research and presentation of it. 

## Faculty-Student Communication
Faculty and advisors use email and ELMS to convey important information, and students are responsible for keeping their email address up to date, and must ensure that forwarding to another address functions properly. Failure to check email, errors in forwarding, and returned email are the responsibility of the student, and do not constitute an excuse for missing announcements or deadlines. In the modern digital world, it is a necessity that you check your email and other forms of digital communication (e.g., ELMS) at least a few times per day and respond promptly to messages. I would suggest checking messages in the morning and evening at the minimum.

## Emergency Protocol 
If the university is closed for an extended period of time, this course will be conducted via video conferencing.

## Course Procedures and Policies   

1) *Attendance and Absences:* Students are expected to attend classes regularly. Consistent attendance offers students the most effective opportunity to gain command of course concepts and materials. After the 3rd unexcused absence, student’s class participation grade will be reduced by 10% for each subsequent absence up to the 6th unexcused absence. More than 6 unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the course. Events that justify an excused absence include: religious observances; mandatory military obligation; illness of the student or illness of an immediate family member; participation in university activities at the request of university authorities; and compelling circumstances beyond the student’s control (e.g., death in the family, required court appearance). Absences stemming from work duties other than military obligation (e.g., unexpected changes in shift assignments) and traffic/transit problems do not typically qualify for excused absence. Students claiming an excused absence must notify the course instructor in a timely manner and provide appropriate documentation. The notification should be provided either prior to the absence or as soon afterwards as possible. In the case of religious observances, athletic events, and planned absences known at the beginning of the semester, the student must inform the instructor during the schedule adjustment period. All other absences must be reported as soon as is practical. The student must provide appropriate documentation of the absence. The documentation must be provided in writing to the instructor. The full university attendance/absence policy can be found here: http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html.   

2) *Academic Integrity:* The UMD Honor Code prohibits students from cheating on exams, plagiarizing papers, submitting the same paper for credit in two courses without authorization, buying papers, submitting fraudulent documents and forging signatures. On every examination, paper or other academic exercise not exempted by the instructor, students must write by hand and sign the following pledge: “I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this examination (or assignment).” Allegations of academic dishonesty will be reported directly to the Student Honor Council: http://www.shc.umd.edu. Students who engage in academic dishonesty in this course will receive no points for the assignment in question, and will be immediately reported to the Honor Council and Office of Judicial Programs for further action. There will be no warnings.  Remember, cheating, plagiarism or other types of fabrication are never worth it. Definitions for plagiarism, fabrication, cheating, etc. can be found at: http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html.   
3) *Disability Support:* Students with a documented disability should inform the instructors within the add-drop period if academic accommodations will be needed. NB: You are expected to meet with your instructor in person to provide them with a copy of the Accommodations Letter and to obtain your instructor’s signature on the Acknowledgement of Student Request form. You and your instructor will plan together how accommodations will be implemented throughout the semester. To obtain the required Accommodation Letter, please contact Disability Support Service (DSS) at 301-314-7682 or dissup@umd.edu.   

4) *Copyright Notice:* Class lectures and other materials are protected by a Creative Commonons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license. Copyright infringements may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.   

5) *Academic Accommodations for Students Who Experience Sexual Misconduct:* The University of Maryland is committed to providing support and resources, including academic accommodations, for students who experience sexual or relationship violence as defined by the University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy. To report an incident and/or obtain an academic accommodation, contact the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct at 301-405-1142. If you wish to speak confidentially, contact Campus Advocates Respond and Educate (CARE) to Stop Violence at 301-741-3555. As ‘responsible university employees’ faculty are required to report any disclosure of sexual misconduct, i.e., they may not hold such disclosures in confidence. For more information: http://www.umd.edu/ocrsm/" http://www.umd.edu/ocrsm/    

6) *Diversity:* The University of Maryland values the diversity of its student body. Along with the University, the instructor(s) are committed to providing a classroom atmosphere that encourages the equitable participation of all students regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Potential devaluation of students in the classroom that can occur by reference to demeaning stereotypes of any group and/or overlooking the contributions of a particular group to the topic under discussion is inappropriate and will not be tolerated.
