Course Overview
-----
This summer course will run from June 1st to August 20th, and will provide students a unique opportunity to learn about the Arabic script manuscript tradition as a whole, its paleographic and codicological features, and digital humanist tools and methods especially suited to paleographic and codicological concerns. All of these components will be treated in a unitary and mutually reinforcing manner, such that by the end of the course students will have gained both knowledge and practical experience in the use and understanding of the Arabic script manuscript tradition along with digital tools and techniques that will both facilitate this understanding and transform how students interact with and think about manuscripts. Students will be exposed to the full breadth of the Arabic script tradition, from West Africa to China, in both the 'classical' languages of Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkish as well as examples of vernaculars written in Arabic script, with special focus given to script traditions often treated as 'marginal.' While manuscripts will be our primary focus, time will also be devoted to the vast but underappreciated output of lithographed texts in the 19th and 20th centuries, books which in many ways partake of manuscript culture and often entail some level of paleographic knowledge to read.

The course will begin with a three-day intensive workshop designed to provide participants a general overview of Arabic script paleography and codicology, examining the history of Arabic script’s development and the elaboration of Islamicate manuscript traditions from origins to the present. Basic digital codicology will also be introduced during this workshop through guided in-class transcription and metadata annotation exercises. Beginning in the second week, the course will tackle specific topics in paleography, digital codicology, and Islamicate digital humanities broadly while also focusing each week on a distinct script style. Attention will be paid to specific genres of texts with particular paleographic and codicological profiles, such as Qur’anic tafsīr or legal and bureaucratic literature and documents. Digital tools and methods will be introduced in conjunction, pointing students towards various tools for creating digital critical editions, geotagging manuscript corpora, rendering transcriptions in markdown, and so on, with different possible trajectories and approaches possible depending on students' particular interests.

The range of scripts and genres will ensure that students encounter and interact with manuscripts drawn from the breadth of the Islamicate world, including often neglected regions such as West Africa and Southeast Asia. Participants will spend significant time practicing their paleographical skills each week outside of class by annotating and transcribing/correcting transcriptions of manuscript samples drawn from that week’s script. In the process, they will improve their paleography skills and become partners in the production of the evaluation corpus for the ACDC project. The course will also feature three guest speakers who will address specific issues related to Arabic-script paleography, digital codicology, and Islamicate digital humanities. 

The total time commitment expected of course participants is approximately fifteen hours per week. This estimate includes class meetings and time outside of class spent on practice transcriptions and annotation. After the initial intensive three-day introductory session, each week’s class time will consist of one day of lecture and discussion and one day of hands-on training in specific script styles and structural metadata annotation of different styles of manuscript layout. An average of an hour and half will be allotted to each week’s lecture and discussion component and an hour and a half to two hours for the hands-on training components, time differences relative to script difficulty.
