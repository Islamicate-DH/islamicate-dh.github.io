title: The Islamicate World 2.0 Course
subtitle: Studying Islamic Cultures through Computational Textual Analysis
---

_The Islamicate World 2.0: Studying Islamic Cultures through Computational Textual Analysis_ is a [Global Classrooms course](https://globalmaryland.umd.edu/content/global-classrooms) that will be offered for the first time in the fall of 2016 by the University of Maryland (College Park) and Universit√§t Leipzig. In this exciting, new project-based course, students from both institutions will come together to learn the basics of computational textual analysis while participating as student researchers in the nascent project of exploring the vast and largely unexplored tomes of textual data about the Islamicate world. It will also introduce students to theoretical and methodological debates in the field of global digital humanities. Like the digital humanities field that inspires its approach, it will be a highly interdisciplinary course that studies texts from multiple genres (lyric poetry to historical chronicles, legal treatises to the Quran) and languages (Arabic, Persian) with the aid of computational textual analysis tools. There are no language prerequisites, but it is preferable if students at least have elementary knowledge of either Arabic, Persian, Turkish, or Urdu.
